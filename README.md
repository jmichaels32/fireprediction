# CS231N Final Project
## Wildfire Prediction using Computer Vision

This project explores wildfire prediction using state-of-the-art computer vision and physics based models. It was built to operate only on satellite imagery, though if explanatory variables exist (topography, vegetation, drought index, etc.), these values can be appended to the satellite imagery for richer features and better downstream performance.
